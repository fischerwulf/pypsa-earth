Mathematical Modeling Framework
================================

**Optimization Problem Formulation**

PyPSA-Earth formulates energy system planning as a linear optimization problem that minimizes total system costs while satisfying physical and operational constraints.

**Objective Function**

The model minimizes the total Annualized Costs (AC) of the energy system:

.. math::

   \min AC = \sum_{i,r} (c_{i,r} \cdot G_{i,r}) + \sum_l (c_l \cdot F_l) + \sum_{i,s} (c_{i,s}^{store} \cdot H_{i,s}^{store} + c_{i,s}^- \cdot H_{i,s}^- + c_{i,s}^+ \cdot H_{i,s}^+) + \sum_{i,r,t} (o_{i,r} \cdot g_{i,r,t} \cdot w_t) + \sum_{i,s,t} ((o_{i,s}^+ \cdot h_{i,s,t}^+ + o_{i,s}^- \cdot h_{i,s,t}^-) \cdot w_t) + \sum_{i,s,t} (o_{i,s}^{store} \cdot e_{i,s,t} \cdot w_t)

**Cost Components**

*Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)*:
* Generation capacity investments: Installing new power plants and renewable generators
* Storage system investments: Energy capacity, charging, and discharging equipment
* Transmission infrastructure: New power lines and grid reinforcements

*Operational Expenditures (OPEX)*:
* Variable generation costs: Fuel costs, operation and maintenance
* Storage operation costs: Charging, discharging, and energy level maintenance
* Time-weighted costs: Accounting for different operational periods throughout the year

**Physical and Operational Constraints**

The optimization is subject to multiple constraint categories that ensure realistic system operation:

**Energy Balance Constraints**

*Kirchhoff's Current Law* - ensures energy balance at every network node:

.. math::

   \sum_r g_{i,r,t} - \sum_s h_{i,s,t}^+ + \sum_s h_{i,s,t}^- + \sum_l K_{i,l} \cdot f_{l,t} = d_{i,t}

where generation, storage charging/discharging, and power flows must exactly meet demand at each location and time.

*Kirchhoff's Voltage Law* - maintains voltage angle consistency in AC networks:

.. math::

   \sum_l C_{l,c} \cdot x_l \cdot f_{l,t} = 0

This constraint ensures that voltage angle differences around closed network cycles sum to zero, representing the physics of power flow.

**Capacity Constraints**

*Installation Limits*:
* Generator capacity bounds: :math:`\underline{G}_{i,r} \leq G_{i,r} \leq \overline{G}_{i,r}`
* Storage capacity bounds: :math:`\underline{H}_{i,s} \leq H_{i,s} \leq \overline{H}_{i,s}`
* Transmission capacity bounds: :math:`\underline{F}_l \leq F_l \leq \overline{F}_l`

*Operational Limits*:
* Renewable generation availability: :math:`0 \leq g_{i,r,t} \leq \overline{g}_{i,r,t} \cdot G_{i,r}`
* Storage charging/discharging rates: :math:`0 \leq h_{i,s,t}^{\pm} \leq H_{i,s}^{\pm}`
* Power flow limits: :math:`0 \leq f_{l,t} \leq \overline{f}_{l,t} \cdot F_l`

**Storage Modeling**

*Energy Balance*:

.. math::

   e_{i,s,t} = \eta_{i,s}^{store} \cdot e_{i,s,t-1} + \eta_{i,s}^+ \cdot w_t \cdot h_{i,s,t}^+ - \eta_{i,s}^{-1} \cdot w_t \cdot h_{i,s,t}^- + w_t \cdot h_{i,s,t}^{inflow} - w_t \cdot h_{i,s,t}^{spillage}

*Storage Constraints*:
* Energy capacity limits: :math:`0 \leq e_{i,s,t} \leq H_{i,s}^{store}`
* Cyclic operation: :math:`e_{i,s,0} = e_{i,s,T}` (storage levels must return to initial state)
* Technology-specific energy-to-power ratios: :math:`0 \leq e_{i,s,t} \leq T^s \cdot H_{i,s}^-`

**Environmental Constraints**

*Emissions Limits*:

.. math::

   \sum_{i,r,t} g_{i,r,t} \cdot \gamma_r \leq GHG

where :math:`\gamma_r` represents the emission intensity of technology :math:`r` and :math:`GHG` is the total allowable emissions.

**Solution Properties**

*Linear Programming Advantages*:
* Convex optimization problem ensures global optimality
* Efficient solution algorithms can handle large-scale problems
* Unique objective value with potentially multiple operational solutions
* Computational tractability for multi-year, high-resolution studies

*High-Resolution Modeling*:
* Temporal resolution: Hourly optimization over full years (8,760 hours)

  }


Workflow
========

The generation of the model is controlled by the workflow management system `Snakemake <https://snakemake.bitbucket.io/>`_. In a nutshell,
the ``Snakefile`` declares for each python script in the ``scripts`` directory a rule which describes which files the scripts consume and
produce (their corresponding input and output files). The ``snakemake`` tool then runs the scripts in the correct order according to the
rules' input/output dependencies. Moreover, it is able to track, what parts of the workflow have to be regenerated, when a data file or a
script is modified/updated. For example, by executing the following snakemake routine

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % snakemake -j 1 networks/elec_s_128.nc

the following workflow is automatically executed.

.. image:: img/workflow_introduction.png
    :align: center

The **blocks** represent the individual rules which are required to create the file ``networks/elec_s_128.nc``.
Each rule requires scripts (e.g. Python) to convert inputs to outputs.
The **arrows** indicate the outputs from preceding rules which a particular rule takes as input data.

.. note::
    For reproducibility purposes, the image can be obtained through
    ``snakemake --dag networks/elec_s_128.nc | dot -Tpng -o workflow.png``
    using `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_
